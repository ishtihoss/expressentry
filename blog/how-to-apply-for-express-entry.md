Express Entry is Canada's flagship immigration system for skilled workers. If you're considering applying, here's a comprehensive guide to help you navigate the process.

## Step 1: Determine Your Eligibility

Before you begin, make sure you're eligible for one of the three programs managed under Express Entry:

- Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP)
- Federal Skilled Trades Program (FSTP)
- Canadian Experience Class (CEC)

Each program has specific requirements related to work experience, language ability, and education.

## Step 2: Gather Required Documents

You'll need several documents to support your application:

- Valid passport
- Language test results (IELTS or CELPIP for English; TEF for French)
- Educational Credential Assessment (ECA) for education obtained outside Canada
- Proof of work experience
- Police certificates
- Medical exam results

## Step 3: Create an Express Entry Profile

Once you have your documents ready:

1. Go to the official IRCC website
2. Create a secure account
3. Fill out the online Express Entry profile form
4. Submit your profile

## Step 4: Receive Your CRS Score

After submitting your profile, you'll be assigned a Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) score based on factors like age, education, work experience, and language skills.

## Step 5: Enter the Express Entry Pool

Eligible candidates are placed in the Express Entry pool, where they're ranked against each other based on their CRS scores.

## Step 6: Receive an Invitation to Apply (ITA)

If your score is high enough, you may receive an ITA during one of the regular draws from the pool.

## Step 7: Submit Your Application

Once you receive an ITA, you have 60 days to submit a complete application for permanent residence.

## Step 8: Wait for Processing

IRCC aims to process most Express Entry applications within 6 months.

Remember, the Express Entry process can be complex and time-sensitive. Consider seeking advice from a regulated immigration consultant or lawyer if you need assistance.

Good luck with your Express Entry application!
