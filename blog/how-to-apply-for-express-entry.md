[Express Entry](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry.html) is Canada's flagship immigration system for skilled workers. If you're considering applying, here's a comprehensive guide to help you navigate the process.

## Step 1: Determine Your Eligibility

Before you begin, make sure you're eligible for one of the three programs managed under Express Entry:

- [Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP)](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/eligibility/federal-skilled-workers.html)
- [Federal Skilled Trades Program (FSTP)](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/eligibility/skilled-trades.html)
- [Canadian Experience Class (CEC)](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/eligibility/canadian-experience-class.html)

Each program has specific requirements related to work experience, language ability, and education.

## Step 2: Gather Required Documents

You'll need several documents to support your application:

- Valid passport
- Language test results ([IELTS](https://www.ielts.org/) or [CELPIP](https://www.celpip.ca/) for English; [TEF](https://www.lefrancaisdesaffaires.fr/en/tests-diplomas/test-for-evaluating-french-tef/tef-canada/) for French)
- [Educational Credential Assessment (ECA)](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/documents/education-assessed.html) for education obtained outside Canada
- Proof of work experience
- [Police certificates](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/medical-police/police-certificates.html)
- [Medical exam](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/medical-police/medical-exams.html) results

## Step 3: Create an Express Entry Profile

Once you have your documents ready:

1. Go to the [official IRCC website](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/immigration-citizenship.html)
2. [Create a secure account](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/account.html)
3. Fill out the online Express Entry profile form
4. Submit your profile

## Step 4: Receive Your CRS Score

After submitting your profile, you'll be assigned a [Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) score](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/eligibility/criteria-comprehensive-ranking-system.html) based on factors like age, education, work experience, and language skills.

## Step 5: Enter the Express Entry Pool

Eligible candidates are placed in the Express Entry pool, where they're ranked against each other based on their CRS scores.

## Step 6: Receive an Invitation to Apply (ITA)

If your score is high enough, you may receive an ITA during one of the [regular draws](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/submit-profile/rounds-invitations.html) from the pool.

## Step 7: Submit Your Application

Once you receive an ITA, you have 60 days to submit a complete application for permanent residence.

## Step 8: Wait for Processing

IRCC aims to process most Express Entry applications within 6 months.

Remember, the Express Entry process can be complex and time-sensitive. Consider seeking advice from a regulated immigration consultant or lawyer if you need assistance.

Good luck with your Express Entry application!
